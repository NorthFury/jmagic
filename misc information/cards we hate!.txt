Azusa, Lost but Seeking (and Summer Bloom, etc.)
	Playing additional lands is possibly one of the most confusing things,
	like, ever.  Situation:
	First main phase, I play Azusa.  I can now play three lands this turn.
	I play a land, and declare that it is "for" Azusa.  I play another land,
	and that one is also "for" Azusa.  Now, if Azusa leaves play, I STILL HAVE
	MY LAND DROP FOR THE TURN AVAILABLE.  If I play another Azusa, I CAN STILL
	PLAY TWO MORE LANDS!
	
Crucible of Worlds
	Single-handedly caused us to add a second category of permissions for
	playing lands.
	
Seedborn Muse
	CHANGES THE RULES OF THE GAME to add a new game action which untaps your
	cards.  Good lord, could it get any more complicated?
	
Piracy
	... Yes, it CAN get more complicated.  Playing abilities of cards you don't
	control... ugh
	
Primitive Justice
	"As an additional cost to play ~, you may pay [a] and/or [b] any number of
	times." ... lolwut?  Each time you pay one of these costs, it adds a target.
	Except not, since choosing targets comes before paying costs; you'll have to
	announce your intent to pay each of those costs some number of times, then
	choose targets, then pay the costs.
